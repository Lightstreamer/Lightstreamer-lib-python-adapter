1.1.0 (2017-12-19)
+++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Modified the signature of the notify_mpn_device_access and
  notify_mpn_device_token_change methods of the MetadataProvider class,
  to add a session ID argument.
  Existing Remote Metadata Adapters leveraging notify_mpn_device_access
  and/or notify_mpn_device_token_change have to be ported to the new signature.

- Revised the public constants defined in the MpnPlatformType class.
  The constants referring to the supported platforms have got new names,
  whereas the constants for platforms not yet supported have been removed.
  Existing Remote Metadata Adapters explicitly referring to the constants
  have to be aligned.

- Removed the subclasses of MpnSubscriptionInfo (namely
  MpnApnsSubscriptionInfo and MpnGcmSubscriptionInfo) that were used
  by the SDK library to supply the attributes of the MPN subscriptions
  in notify_mpn_subscription_activation. Now, simple instances of
  MpnSubscriptionInfo will be supplied and attribute information can be
  obtained through the new "notification_format" property.
  See the MPN chapter on the General Concepts document for details on the
  characteristics of the Notification Format.
  Existing Remote Metadata Adapters
  leveraging notify_mpn_subscription_activation and inspecting the supplied
  MpnSubscriptionInfo have to be ported to the new class contract.

- Improved the interface documentation of MPN-related methods.

- Clarified in the docs for notifySessionClose which race conditions with other
  methods can be expected.

- Aligned the documentation to comply with current licensing policies.
