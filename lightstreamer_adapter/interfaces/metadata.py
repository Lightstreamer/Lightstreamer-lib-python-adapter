class MetadataProvider():
    """Provides a base class to be extended by a Remote Metadata Adapter in
    order to attach a Metadata Provider to Lightstreamer.

    To facilitate the coding of the Adapter, each method provides a default
    implementation to allow a simple default behavoiur, which can be overridden
    by extending this class and supplying the custom implementation.

    Such default behavoiur will be specified in this documentation trough the
    use of the marker: **IMPLEMENTATION NOTE**.

    An instance of a Remote Metadata Adapter is supplied to Lightstreamer
    through a :class:`lightstreamer_adapter.server.MetadataProviderServer`
    instance.

    A Metadata Provider is used by Lightstreamer Kernel in combination with one
    or multiple Data Providers, uniquely associated with it; it is consulted
    in order to manage the push Requests intended for the associated Data
    Providers. A Metadata Provider supplies informations for several different
    goals:

    * the resolution of the Group/Schema names used in the Requests;
    * the check of the User accessibility to the requested Items;
    * the check of the resource level granted to the User;
    * the request for specific characteristics of the Items.

    Note: Each Item may be supplied by one or more of the associated Data
    Adapters and each client Request must reference to a specific Data Adapter.
    However, in the current version of the interface, no Data Adapter
    information is supplied to the Metadata Adapter methods. Hence, the Item
    names must provide enough information for the methods to give an answer.
    As a consequence, for instance, the frequency, snapshot length and other
    characteristics of an item are the same regardless of the Data Adapter
    it is requested from. More likely, for each item name defined, only one
    of the Data Adapters in the set is responsible for supplying that item.

    All implementation methods should perform as fast as possible. See the
    notes on the corresponding methods in the Java In-Process interface for the
    method-related details. Also consider that the roundtrip time involved in
    the remote call adds up to each call time anyway.

    In order to avoid that delays on calls for one session propagate to other
    sessions, the size of the thread pool devoted to the management of the
    client requests should be properly set, through the <server_pool_max_size>
    flag, in the Server configuration file.

    Alternatively, a dedicated pool, properly sized, can be defined for the
    involved Adapter Set in the adapters.xml. Still more restricted dedicated
    pools can be defined for the authorization-related calls and for each Data
    Adapter in the Adapter Set. The latter pool would also run any Metadata
    Adapter method related to the items supplied by the specified Data Adapter.

        Another typical case is when the same Item has different contents
