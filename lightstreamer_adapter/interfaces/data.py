class DataProvider(metaclass=ABCMeta):
    """Provides an abstract class meant to be extended by a Remote Data Adapter
    in order to attach a Data Provider to Lightstreamer. An instance of a
    Remote Data Adapter is supplied to Lightstreamer through a
    :class:`lightstreamer_adapter.server.DataProviderServer` instance. After
    initialization, Lightstreamer sets itself as the Remote Data Adapter
    listener, by calling the :meth:`set_listener` method.

    Data Providers are used by Lightstreamer Kernel to obtain all data to be
    pushed to the Clients. Any Item requested by a Client must refer to one
    supplied by the configured Data Adapters.

    A Data Provider supplies data in a publish/subscribe way. Lightstreamer
    asks for data by calling the
    :meth:`subscribe` and :meth:`unsubscribe` methods for various Items and
    the Data Adapter sends ItemEvents to its listener in an asynchronous way.

    A Data Adapter can also support Snapshot management. Upon subscription to
    an Item, the current state of the Item data can be sent to the Server
    before the updates. This allows the Server to maintain the Item state, by
    integrating the new ItemEvents into the state (in a way that depends on the
    Item type) and to make this state available to the Clients.

    Note that the interaction between the Server and the Data Adapter and the
    interaction between the Server and any Client are independent activities.
    As a consequence, the very first ItemEvents sent by the Data Adapter to the
    Server for an Item just subscribed to might be processed before the Server
    starts feeding any client, even the client that caused the subscription to
    the Item to be invoked; then, such events would not be forwarded to any
    client. If it is desirable that a client receives all the ItemEvents that
    have been produced for an Item by the Data Adapter since subscription time,
    then the support for the Item Snapshot can be leveraged.

    Lightstreamer1 ensures that calls to
    :meth:`.subscribe` and
    :meth:`.unsubscribe` for
    the same Item will be interleaved, without redundant calls; whenever
    subscribe raises an exception, the corresponding unsubscribe call is not
    issued.

        """Called by Lightstreamer Remote Server to request data for an Item.
        If the request succeeds, the Remote Data Adapter can start sending an
        ItemEvent to the listener for any update of the Item value. Before
        sending the updates, the Remote Data Adapter may optionally send one or
        more ItemEvents to supply the current Snapshot.

        The general rule to be followed for event dispatching is::

         if issnapshot_available(itemName) == true
             SNAP* [EOS] UPD*
         else
             UPD*

        where:

        * SNAP represents an :meth:`ItemEventListener.update` call with the
          ``issnapshot`` flag set to ``True``
        * EOS represents an :meth:`ItemEventListener.end_of_snapshot` call
        * UPD represents an :meth:`ItemEventListener.update` call with the
          ``issnapshot`` flag set to ``False``; in this case, the special
          :meth:`clear_snapshot` call can also be issued.

        The composition of the snapshot depends on the Mode in which the Item
        is to be processed. In particular, for MERGE mode, the snapshot
        consists of one event and the first part of the rule becomes::

        [SNAP] [EOS] UPD*

        where a missing snapshot is considered as an empty snapshot.

        If an Item can be requested only in RAW mode, then
        :meth:`DataProvider.issnapshot_available` should always return
        ``False``; anyway, when an Item is requested in RAW mode, any snapshot
        is discarded.

        Note that calling :meth:`ItemEventListener.end_of_snapshot` is not
        mandatory; however, not calling it in DISTINCT or COMMAND mode may
        cause the server to keep the snapshot and forward it to the clients
        only after the first no-shapshot event has been received. The same
        happens for MERGE mode if neither the snapshot nor the endOfSnapshot
        call are supplied.

        Unexpected snapshot events are converted to non-snapshot events (but
        for RAW mode, where they are ignored); unexpected
        :meth:`ItemEventListener.end_of_snapshot` calls are ignored.

        The method can be blocking, but, as the Proxy Adapter implements
        subscribe and unsubscribe asynchronously, subsequent
        subscribe-unsubscribe-subscribe-unsubscribe requests can still be
        issued by Lightstreamer Server to the Proxy Adapter. When this happens,
